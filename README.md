# ImageClassification
Plant Disease Classification Project
This GitHub repository contains code for a plant disease classification project using Python libraries for data preparation and classification analysis.
Project Overview
The project aims to classify plant images into different disease categories using machine learning techniques. The code provided in this repository guides users through the data preparation process and model building for accurate classification.
Key Steps
Data Preparation: The code includes steps to preprocess the data, handle missing values, and encode labels using LabelEncoder. Additionally, it demonstrates oversampling techniques like RandomOverSampler for imbalanced datasets.
Feature Extraction: Feature extraction techniques such as Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) are applied to extract relevant features from images for classification.
Model Building: The code showcases the use of popular classification algorithms like SVM, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, and LightGBM for training and evaluating the models.
Generating Plots: Users can generate plots to visualize the data distribution, model performance, and feature importance for better insights.
